Identity Configuration
======================================

You can check out the `video`_ for this section.

TRAC token that is required for OriginTrail Decentralized Network is based on ERC20 standard that utilizes Ethereum network. In order to utilize the ODN you will need **both TRAC and ETH tokens** on your wallet. ERC20 standard enables use of one wallet for both crypto currencies.

ODN testnet is based on Ethereum test network Rinkeby and test Trac tokens (TRAC). We strongly advise use of dedicated wallet for ODN TestNet for security reasons. Please don't store real TRAC tokens and ETH on that wallet in this stage. Test TRAC and Rinkeby ETH have no commercial value.

OriginTrail is not responsible for setup and use of wallets and related software. We also do not provide support for this software.

If you need test TRAC token please visit our faucet `faucet`_ page.

Metamask
~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to get wallet is to install **MetaMask**. MetaMask is a
Chrome Extension that allows you to interact with the Ethereum network
without having to run a node on your system.

You can download MetaMask from `metamask.io`_.

Install the Chrome plugin. This adds a little fox icon to your extension
bar. Click on the icon and follow instructions to accept disclaimer and
terms & conditions.

When you click on the top left "Ethereum Main Net" button of the
MetaMask window you be able to select the node you want to connect to.
Please use **Rinkeby Test Network** when dealing with testnet scenario.

Wallet
~~~~~~

Once **MetaMask** is connected, you will have to enter a new password to
encrypt your new MetaMask vault that will hold your keys generated by
MetaMask. You will get a new wallet address.

In order to copy your wallet address, click on three dots on top right
corner and select **Copy Address to clipboard**.

To get a private key you can click on the same menu and select **Export
Private Key**.

Alternatively, if you need to create a new wallet and associate it to
MetaMask, you can go to https://www.myetherwallet.com/ and follow the
procedure. In the last step just select **Connect to Metamask**.

Get some funds on the wallet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to run node you will need some Ether and TRAC on our wallet. Initially your
balance will be 0. 

For running testnet node, get some test Ether from
https://faucet.rinkeby.io/ and follow the instructions. Remember, test
network Ether does not have any exchange value, it's just for testing
and development purposes.

For running mainnet node, one needs real Ether and Trac.

Once you get Ether/TRAC on your account, you will be able to see new balance
in MetaMask.

ERC725 Identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ERC 725 is a proposed standard for blockchain-based identity authored by Fabian Vogelsteller,
creator of ERC 20 and Web3.js. ERC 725 describes proxy smart contracts that can be controlled by multiple
keys and other smart contracts and it lives on Ethereum blockchain.

The easiest way to find values of these two identities is to search for them in running node's log.

::

        notify - Identity created for node ab2e1b1e520cac0d1321cd3760c2e7473970ec8a.
        Identity is 0x99c67054a8c7b7fa62243f0446eacd80c6ff0aff.

The last value (in above case 0x99c67054a8c7b7fa62243f0446eacd80c6ff0aff) represent ERC 725 identity.
Alternatively, if you login into running node's container


::

        docker exec -it otnode /bin/bash
        cd data && ls -al

one of the files here should be **erc725_identity.json**, whose value should exactly match value shown in the log line.

For the **Node identity**, simply find a log line similar to this:

::

        notify - My network identity: ab2e1b1e520cac0d1321cd3760c2e7473970ec8a

and this value ( in above example ab2e1b1e520cac0d1321cd3760c2e7473970ec8a) it what you are looking for.

Some users might notice that in data folder there exist also file called **identity.json**,
and that value stored in this file is different from node identity value from logs.
Identity.json contains atomic information about the node identity - identity itself is created based on it.

Having above said, final **important** note:
If you wish to run identical node on some other machine, then in addition to backing up you node wallet/private key,
please back up erc725_identity.json and identity.json
files. There will be a separate article on how to start node with previously backed up identities.
For now, be aware if you start a node on a different machine with providing only node wallet/private key,
node will create new identities, and you end up having different node.
