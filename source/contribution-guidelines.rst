Contribution Guidelines
========================

We'd love for you to contribute to our source code and to make OT
protocol better than it is today! Here are the guidelines we'd like you
to follow.

If you're new to OT node development, there are guides in this wiki for
getting your dev environment set up. Get to know the commit process with
something small like a bug fix. If you're not sure where to start post a
message on the Discord #general channel.

Once you've got your feet under you then you can start working on larger
features. For anything more than a bug fix, it probably makes sense to
coordinate through the Discord, since it's possible someone else is
working on the same thing.

Please make descriptive commit messages.

The following checklist is worked through for every commit:

-  Check out and try the changeset.
-  Ensure that the code follows the language coding conventions.
-  Ensure that the code is well designed and architected.

Pull Requests
========================

If you report an issue, we’d love to see a pull request attached. Please
keep in mind that your commit may end up getting modified. Sometimes
we’ll make the change ourselves, but often we’ll just let you know what
needs to happen and help you fix it up yourself.

Contributor Code of Conduct
================================

As contributors and maintainers of the OT Node project, we pledge to
respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating
documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments,
and any other activities.

Communication through any of our channels (GitHub, Discord, Twitter,
etc.) must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks,
trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional
conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this
project regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation,
disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We
expect anyone contributing to the project to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the
maintainers of the OT Node project may take action, removing issues,
comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any
other concerns, please email us.

Questions, Bugs, Features
==================================

Got a Question or Problem?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep
GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You've got much
better chances of getting your question answered on Discord.

Found an Issue or Bug?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an
issue to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better, you can submit a
Pull Request with a fix.

Missing a Feature?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our [GitHub
Repository][github-issues].

If you would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of
change it is:

-  **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should
   be discussed first in an [GitHub issue][github-issues] that clearly
   outlines the changes and benefits of the feature.
-  **Small Changes** can directly be crafted and submitted to the
   [GitHub Repository][github] as a Pull Request. See the section about
   Pull Request Submission Guidelines, and for detailed information
   the [core development documentation][developers].

Want a Doc Fix?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Should you have a suggestion for the documentation, you can open an
issue and outline the problem or improvement you have - however,
creating the doc fix yourself is much better!

If you want to help improve the docs, it's a good idea to let others
know what you're working on to minimize duplication of effort. Create a
new issue (or comment on a related existing one) to let others know what
you're working on.

If you're making a small change (typo, phrasing) don't worry about
filing an issue first. Use the friendly blue "Improve this doc" button
at the top right of the doc page to fork the repository in-place and
make a quick change on the fly. The commit message is preformatted to
the right type and scope, so you only have to add the description.

For large fixes, please build and test the documentation before
submitting the PR to be sure you haven't accidentally introduced any
layout or formatting issues. You should also make sure that your commit
message follows the **[Commit Message Guidelines][developers.commits]**.
