<span id="incentive-model"></span><h1>Network structure<a class="headerlink" href="#network-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The network layer takes care of the accessibility and data governance of the underlying data
layer. It consists of network nodes which all contain parts of the decentralized database and
store graphs of the data. Access to the data is achieved through the provided data exchange
API.</p>
<p>The peer to peer network is built on a distributed hash table based on Kademlia which is
responsible for efficient routing within the network. The messages between peers are signed,
while the Kademlia node ID presents a valid Ethereum address which the node is able to
spend from. This enforces long-term identity and helps with Kademlia routing and Eclipse
attacks.</p>
<p>The peer-to-peer decentralized network operates as a serverless supply
chain data storage, validation and serving network with built in
fault-tolerance, DDoS resistance, tamper-proof resistance and
self-sustaining based on the incentive system explained in this
document.</p>
<p>The intention of this paper is to document the research findings and
mechanics behind the incentive model of OriginTrail, as well as to
attract opinions and feedback from the community and researchers
interested in the topic.</p>
<div class="section" id="network-entities-and-classification">
<h2>Network entities and classification<a class="headerlink" href="#network-entities-and-classification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to better understand the OriginTrail P2P network structure and
the incentive mechanisms within the protocol we have to understand all
different roles within the context of the system.</p>
<p>The main premise is that the different nodes have different interests
given their roles. In order to provide fair play on the network and
provide a fair market, we have to understand different entities, their
aims, needs and relationships. Above all we have to understand
possibilities of collusion of different entities and their possible
motives and therefore construct incentives in order to mitigate them.</p>
<p>It is important to state that all the nodes are operated by the same
software, but rather their function in the context of observed data
determines how the nodes are perceived - one node can have different
roles within different deals. Below is a list of different entities and
their roles in the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-provider">
<h2>Data Provider<a class="headerlink" href="#data-provider" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>The data provider (DP)</strong> - is an entity that publishes supply chain
data to the network. A typical scenario would be a company that would
like to publish and share its data from their ERP system about the
products that are part of the supply chain. Data providers can also be
consumers which are interacting with the network through applications,
or devices such as sensors which provide information about significant
events in the supply chain.</p>
<p>The interest of the data provider is to be able to safely store the data
on the network as well as to be able to connect it and cross-check with
the data of other DPs within the network. Depending on the use case,
providing the data to the network can be incentivised with the Trace
token.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-creator-node">
<h2>Data Creator Node<a class="headerlink" href="#data-creator-node" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>The Data Creator node (DC)</strong> - is an entity that represents a node
which will be responsible for importing the data provided by the DP,
making sure that all the criteria of DP are met - such as availability
of the data on the network for a desired time and a factor of
replication. While we expect typically that Data Providers will run
their own Data Creator nodes, it is not a requirement - third party DC
nodes may provide the service for one or several Data Providers. The DC
node is an entry point of the information to the network and the
relationship between the DP and DC is not regulated by the protocol.</p>
<p>The responsibility of the DC node is to negotiate, establish and
maintain the service requested by the DP in relationship with its
associated Data Holder nodes (DH). Furthermore, DC nodes are responsible
to check if data is available on the network during the time of service
and initiate the litigation process in case of any disputes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-holder-node">
<h2>Data Holder Node<a class="headerlink" href="#data-holder-node" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Data Holder (DH) is a node that has committed itself to store the
data provided by a DC node for a requested period of time and make it
available for the interested parties (which can also be the DC node).
For this service the Data Holder will be compensated in TRAC tokens. The
DH node has the responsibility to preserve the data intact in its
unaltered, original form, as well as to provide high availability of the
data in terms of bandwidth and uptime.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the DH node can be a DC node at the same
time, in the context of the data that it has introduced to the network.
As noted, the same software runs on all the nodes in the network,
providing for symmetrical relations and thus not limiting scalability.</p>
<p>The Data Holder may also wish to find the data not directly delivered by
DCs, but that is popular, and offer it to the interested parties.
Therefore it is probable that Data Holders will listen to the network,
search for data that is frequently requested, and replicate it from
other Data Holders to also store them, process and offer them to the
Data Viewers. However, since such Data Holders are not bound by the
smart contract to provide the service, there is a certain risk that
these Data Holders may offer false data or temper the data, or even
pretend to have the data that they don’t have.</p>
<p>To mitigate this risk, a node will be required to deposit a stake. This
stake will be stored in case it is proven that Data Holder tried to sell
the data which is altered while Data Viewers will have a mechanism to
check if all the chunks of the data are valid and initiate a litigation
procedure in case of any inconsistencies. Furthermore, Data Holders will
be able to provide larger stake if they want to demonstrate their
quality of the service to the Data Viewers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-viewer">
<h2>Data Viewer<a class="headerlink" href="#data-viewer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Data Viewer (DV) is an entity that requests the data from any
network node able to provide that data. The Data Viewer will be able to
send two types of queries to the network. The first type is a request
for a specific set of batch identifiers of the product supply chain they
are interested in, where they will be able to retrieve the all connected
data of the product trail. The second type are custom queries asking for
specific connections between the data. In both cases, the Data Viewer
will receive the offers from all the nodes that have the data together
with charges for reading and structure of the data that will be sent.
The Data Viewer can decide which offers it will accept and deposit the
requested compensation funds on the escrow smart contract. The providing
node then sends the encrypted data in order for the Data Viewer to test
the validity of data. Once the validity of the data is confirmed, the
Data Viewer will get the key to decrypt the data while the smart
contract will unlock the funds for the party that provided the data.</p>
<p>The interest of the Data Viewer is to get the data as affordable as
possible, but also to be sure that the provided data is genuine.
Therefore, the Data Viewer will also have an opportunity to initiate the
litigation procedure in case that received data is not valid. If that
happens, and it is proved that Data Viewer received the false data, the
stake of the corresponding DH node is lost.</p>
<p>The complete picture of interaction between participants in OriginTrail
system is presented on data flow diagram (Figure 1).</p>
<p>[[images/data_flow.png]]</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="service-initiation">
<h2>Service initiation<a class="headerlink" href="#service-initiation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To get data onto OriginTrail network, the Data provider sends tokens and
data to the chosen DC node. The data creator sends tokens to the smart
contract with tailored escrow functionalities and broadcasts a data
holding request with the required terms of cooperation. All interested
DH node candidates then respond with their requirements by submitting
their applications to the smart contract - price of the service per data
unit and minimum time of providing the service.</p>
<p>The minimum factor of replication is 2N+1, where the minimum value for N
is yet to be determined, while the actual factor may be larger as it is
decided by the Data Creator. To mitigate the possibility of fixing the
results of the public offering, only when a certain number of Data
Holders answer the call, which is greater than the requested replication
factor, the smart contract will close the application procedure. Once
the application procedure is finished, the smart contract selects the
required number of Data Holders so a potential malicious Data Creator
who might own several DH nodes can’t influence the process and pick its
own nodes.</p>
<p>The Data Creator will deposit the compensations in tokens for the Data
Holders on an escrow smart contract that Data Holders will be able to
progressively withdraw from as the time passes, and up to the full
amount once the period of service is successfully finished. The smart
contract will take care that the funds are unlocked incrementally. It is
up to the Data Holder to decide how often it will withdraw the funds for
the part of the service that is already delivered.</p>
<p>In order to participate in the service, the Data Holder will also have
to deposit a stake in the amount proportional to the amount of the job
value. This stake is necessary as a measure of security that data will
not be deleted or tempered in any way, and that it will be provided to
third parties according to the requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="servicing-period">
<h2>Servicing period<a class="headerlink" href="#servicing-period" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="data-replication">
<h3>Data replication<a class="headerlink" href="#data-replication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After the agreement between Data creator and Data holders has been
created, the Data holder prepares data by splitting graph vertex data
into blocks and calculating a root hash which is then stored on the
blockchain. The root hash is stored permanently for everyone to be able
to prove the integrity of data. The data is then encrypted using RSA
encryption and encryption key appended to it. A Merkle tree is again
created for the encrypted data blocks, proving integrity of data that
will be sent to Data holder. The root hash of the encrypted data is
written to the escrow contract and finally the data can be sent to Data
holder. Upon receiving data, the Data holder is verifying that root hash
of received data is indeed the one written into escrow contract and if
it is a match the testing and payment process can begin.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing-and-compensation">
<h3>Testing and compensation<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-and-compensation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To ensure that the service is provided as requested, the Data creator is
able to test Data holders by sporadically asking them for a random
encrypted data block. In case when the Data creator has a suspicion that
the data is not available anymore or is altered in any way, it is able
to initiate the litigation procedure in which the smart contract will
decide if the Data holder is able to prove that it still has the data
available.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="litigation-procedure">
<h3>Litigation procedure<a class="headerlink" href="#litigation-procedure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The litigation procedure involves a smart contract as a validator of the
service. When the Data creator is challenging the Data holder to prove
to the smart contract that it is storing the agreed upon data, it sends
a test question to the smart contract in a form of requested data block
number. In response, the Data holder sends the requested block to the
smart contract. Data creator then sends the Merkle proof for the
requested data block and the smart contract calculates if the hash of
requested block fits the proof.</p>
<p>If the proof is not valid for a data block hash there are two options -
the first is that the Data holder is not storing agreed upon data, thus
not being able to submit the correct answer, and the second is that the
Data creator has created and submitted a false (unanswerable) test. The
dilemma is solved by the Data creator sending the correct data block,
that fits the already submitted Merkle proof and Merkle root hash to the
smart contract. If the Data holder’s block is incorrect for the given
proof than the Data holder loses it’s deployed stake and the stake is
transferred to Data creator. In the other way, if Data creator is not
able to prove it’s own proof than it has sent a false test and its stake
is transferred to the Data holder. In case that it is proven that DH
does not have the original data anymore, the smart contract will
initiate the procedure of DH replacement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proving-mechanism">
<h3>Proving mechanism<a class="headerlink" href="#proving-mechanism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Merkle tree for data blocks <em>&lt;B1, B2, … , Bn&gt;</em> is a balanced binary
hash tree where each of internal node is calculated as a SHA3 hash of
the concatenated child nodes. The <em>i-th</em> leaf node <em>Li</em> is calculated as
<em>Li = SHA3(Bi, i)</em>. The root hash <em>R</em> of the Merkle tree is SHA3 hash of
the roots child nodes. The Merkle proof for block <em>Bi</em> is tuple of
hashes <em>&lt;P(0), P(1), .. , P(h−1)&gt;</em> where <em>h</em> is the height of the Merkle
tree. For the proof to be valid, it needs to satisfy the tuple of tests
<em>&lt;T(0), T(1), .. , T(h-1)&gt;</em> such that <em>T(0) = SHA3(Li, P(0))</em> and <em>T(i)
= SHA3(P(i), T(i−1))</em>, for <em>i &gt; 0</em>, and <em>T(h-1) = R</em>. To prove the
integrity of the answer block <em>Bk</em>, the smart contract calculates the
hash _a = L(k) _and calculates proof <em>T(h-1)</em>. If the proof is correct
then the answer blocks integrity is unchanged from when it was created.
The diagram of the proving mechanism is shown on Figure 2.</p>

<h2>Querying data<a class="headerlink" href="#querying-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Data consumer broadcasts a query for the data it needs through its
associated node. Any DH that stores the data can reply to the broadcast.
The data consumer then selects a DH by his own criteria, creates an
escrow contract and deploys tokens for payment. The DH sends the
encrypted data to the Data consumer, and the Data consumer randomly
selects one data block to send it to the escrow contract together with
the block number. After sending, the DH needs to reply with the
unencrypted block, the key that was used for encryption and the Merkle
path proof for proving that block is valid. If everything is valid,
tokens are transferred to the DH node and the Data consumer can take the
key for unlocking data.</p>
