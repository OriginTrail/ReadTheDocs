Wallet Setup
======================================

You can check out the `video`_ for this section.

TRAC token that is required for OriginTrail Decentralized Network is based on ERC20 standard that utilizes Ethereum network. In order to utilize the ODN you will need **both TRAC and ETH tokens** on your wallet. ERC20 standard enables use of one wallet for both crypto currencies.

ODN testnet is based on Ethereum test network Rinkeby and test Trac tokens (TRAC). We strongly advise use of dedicated wallet for ODN TestNet for security reasons. Please don't store real TRAC tokens and ETH on that wallet in this stage. Test TRAC and Rinkeby ETH have no commercial value.

OriginTrail is not responsible for setup and use of wallets and related software. We also do not provide support for this software.

If you need test TRAC token please visit our faucet `faucet`_ page.

Metamask
~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to get wallet is to install **MetaMask**. MetaMask is a
Chrome Extension that allows you to interact with the Ethereum network
without having to run a node on your system.

You can download MetaMask from `metamask.io`_.

Install the Chrome plugin. This adds a little fox icon to your extension
bar. Click on the icon and follow instructions to accept disclaimer and
terms & conditions.

When you click on the top left "Ethereum Main Net" button of the
MetaMask window you be able to select the node you want to connect to.
Please select **Rinkeby Test Network**.

Wallet
~~~~~~

Once **MetaMask** is connected, you will have to enter a new password to
encrypt your new MetaMask vault that will hold your keys generated by
MetaMask. You will get a new wallet address.

In order to copy your wallet address, click on three dots on top right
corner and select **Copy Address to clipboard**. You can use it further
to get some test Ether from the faucet.

To get a private key you can click on the same menu and select **Export
Private Key**.

Alternatively, if you need to create a new wallet and associate it to
MetaMask, you can go to https://www.myetherwallet.com/ and follow the
procedure. In the last step just select **Connect to Metamask**.

Get some funds on the wallet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to test you will need some Ether on our wallet. Initially your
balance will be 0. To get some test Ether to test go to
https://faucet.rinkeby.io/ and follow the instructions. Remember, test
network Ether does not have any exchange value, it's just for testing
and development purposes.

Once you get Ether/test TRAC on your account, you will be able to see new balance
in MetaMask.
