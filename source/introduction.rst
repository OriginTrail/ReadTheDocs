Introduction
============
**OriginTrail is the first Purpose-built Protocol for Supply Chains
Based on Blockchain.**

At the current stage of development, the protocol is deployed in the Vostok mainnet stage. To test out the network, we encourage to use the OriginTrail Testnet which operates together with Ethereum Rinkeby testnet. For further information about
our roadmap please see our `website`_ for more detailed development plans.

The documentation is aimed towards three groups of readers:

-  Node runners
-  Supply chain service providers
-  Software Developers

Setting up the Node
-------------------

In order to join the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN), you need to install the OriginTrail network Node. For detailed instructions on installation and configuration of an OriginTrail node visit following sections:

-  Start with :ref:`node-setup`
-  Refer to :ref:`configuration-setup`
-  Finally :ref:`import-data`.

Service provider guidelines
----------------------------
Service providers are companies that provide supply chain management solutions, consulting or advisory services to help their clients improve efficiencies, enhance product and consumer safety and brand protection activities to name a few. Please visit :ref:`implementation` guidelines for more resources.


Development contribution
------------------------

OriginTrail is an open source project. We happily invite you to join us in our mission of building the protocol to establish more transparency within global supply chains.
