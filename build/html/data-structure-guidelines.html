<p>This page illustrates how to structure data for OriginTrail protocol to
utilize data sharing and connectivity functionalities of the Alpha
version of the OriginTrail Distributed Network (ODN) as part of <a class="reference internal" href="data-layer.html#data-layer"><span class="std std-ref">Data Layer</span></a>. It corresponds to
attachments and examples that are provided with this file and the
documentation on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/ot-node">GitHub</a>. The defined structure was developed on the
best practices observed over the last several years of experience in
implementing transparency solutions within the food supply chain
industry, and is based on GS1 standards.</p>
<div class="section" id="problem-definition">
<h2>Problem definition<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-definition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OriginTrail is a protocol that enables exchange of standardized data
among disparate IT systems in multi organizational environments in a
tamper proof way. Therefore, each participant of the exchange should
provide their data in a common and standardized format. To utilize the
OriginTrail protocol to showcase its full potential,  the communication
from ERP systems of at least two entities within a supply chain towards
ODN needs to be established. The communication is done periodically by
sending standardized XML files to the OriginTrail network node, the
structure of which will be further explained in this document.</p>
<p>Also, OriginTrail stores and processes data that is generated and
received via IoT devices. This data usually is not stored within ERP
system. It is processed through designated software on read points into
JSON data format and then it is processed further. This type of data can
be handled with GS1 EPCIS standard and Web Of Things (WoT) standard.
Regardless which standard is used, ODN will process the data and store
it in graph database. If structured properly, related data from two data
sources (formats) will be interconnected.</p>
<p>The upload of data in the XML format to the OriginTrail protocol node is
performed via the web-service endpoint. The process of extracting data
from the ERP system, including its periodic forwarding to the
OriginTrail node API endpoint is out of the scope of this document. This
document focuses on the standardized data structure that data creator
nodes can process via their importer.</p>

<div class="section" id="types-of-data-structure">
<h2>Types of data structure<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-data-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OriginTrail is primarily focused on GS1 data standards, but other
standards will also be supported.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">

<h3>GS1 EPCIS structure<a class="headerlink" href="#gs1-epcis-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The goal of EPCIS is to enable disparate applications to create and
share visibility event data, both within and across enterprises.
Ultimately, this sharing is aimed at enabling users to gain a shared
view of physical or digital objects within a relevant business context.</p>
<p>The file structure is based on XML data format. Data structuring is
performed with use of official guidelines (EPCIS and CBV). Syntax and
XML node structure fully corresponds to GS1 standards and provided XSD
schemes. OriginTrail has introduced namespace (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/ot-node/wiki/OriginTrail-GS1-EPCIS-customized-namespace">urn:ot:*</a> ) for custom
identifiers. OriginTrail namespace primarily introduces standardization
of attributes that will be used in graph vertexes, while values should
be according to GS1 namespace.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="epcis-data-structuring-guidelines">
<h3>EPCIS data structuring guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#epcis-data-structuring-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Research GS1 implementation guide and OriginTrail guidelines.</li>
<li>Collect the data samples that you want to store on ODN according to
defined use case from official implementation guide and our
documentation and download XSD schemes.</li>
<li>Connect XSD scheme and sample file in some advanced XML editing

<div class="section" id="gs1-epcis-xml-file-structure">
<h2>GS1 EPCIS XML File structure<a class="headerlink" href="#gs1-epcis-xml-file-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The XML file contains three main logical parts <strong>document data</strong>,
<strong>master data</strong> and <strong>visibility events data</strong>. All parts of the file
must be according to GS1 XSD scheme.</p>
<p>The example XML files, as well as the XSD scheme that can be found
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/ot-node/blob/develop/importers/">here</a>. Example files are organized in several folders. Each folder
represents one use case scenario that has several events that are
described in details. Scenarios are described below in this document.</p>
<p>We strongly advise use of advanced XML editing software that will verify
if your data structure corresponds to XSD scheme that is proposed by GS1
if you want to have full compliance of the data structure.</p>
<div class="section" id="document-data">
<h3>Document data<a class="headerlink" href="#document-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>EPCIS guideline suggests “Standard Business Document Header” <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gs1.org/sites/default/files/docs/xml/SBDH_v1_3_Technical_Implementation_Guide.pdf">SBDH</a>
standard for description of the document data. This part of data is in
EPCIS Header part of the file. It has basic information about file
(sender,receiver,ID,purpose…). Although OriginTrail is the receiver of
the file and it can be named as receiver (SBDH allows defining multiple
receivers) it is not necessary to include this. Receiver is some entity
involved in a business process, not in the data processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="master-data">
<h3>Master data<a class="headerlink" href="#master-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>EPCIS standard describes 4 ways to process Master data. OriginTrail is
going to support the most common way - including Master data in the
Header of an EPCIS XML document. Master data will be processed
separately from other data. There is no need to include master data in
every file. Only data that has not been sent to ODN until that moment
should be provided. If there is already the same version of master data
on ODN, it will be omitted and not processed further. But if there is
visibility event data that is related to some master data that is not on
ODN, there can be query problems in graph database (the file is going to
be processed on ODN anyway).</p>
<p>More information about data <a class="reference internal" href="namespace.html#namespace"><span class="std std-ref">Namespace</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="visibility-event-data">
<h3>Visibility event data<a class="headerlink" href="#visibility-event-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Main focus of EPCIS standard is formalizing description of event data
that are generated by activities within supply chain. OriginTrail is
focusing on ObjectEvent, AggregationEvent and TransformationEvent that
are thoroughly described in the standard (although other event types are
also supported). We strongly advise to read <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gs1.org/docs/epc/EPCIS_Guideline.pdf">GS1 EPCIS implementation
guideline</a> and to evaluate our example files.</p>
<p>Event data describes interactions between entities described with master
data by the data creator. OriginTrail distinguishes two types event
data:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Internal events are related to processes of object movements or
transformations (production, repackaging etc) within the scope of one
supply chain participants business location (read point) as part of
some business process. For example, this could be production or
assembly transactions that result in product output for further
production or sale (repackaging, labeling etc). Ownership of objects
does not change during event. Consensus check is not necessary.</li>
<li>External events are related to processes between different supply
chain participants (sales/purchases, transport). They represent
processes where the jurisdiction or ownership of the objects gets
changed in the supply chain. This type of events should use consensus
check.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each event should have a unique ID that connects GS1 event with
corresponding ERP transaction in database from the data creator. The
event data implies that the provider of that data is one of the active
participants in the transaction process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="origintrail-extension-section">
<h3>OriginTrail Extension section<a class="headerlink" href="#origintrail-extension-section" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>EPCIS standard allows extensions of their data set. Please read
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/ot-node/wiki/OriginTrail-GS1-EPCIS-customized-namespace">namespace</a> section for more details. Currently OriginTrail protocol
requires following extensions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>OTEventClass and OTEventType - It corresponds to Event Classes
described in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/ot-node/wiki/Graph-structure-in-OriginTrail-Data-Layer---version-1.0">data layer model</a>. .</li>
<li>documentID - Value represents key for consensus check between
participants. One event can have several documents in Business
Transaction List, but only the documentId value will be used for link
between two events that are described by different entities.
DocumentId mapping must be predetermined so supply chain participants
can know how to trigger consensus check.</li>
<li>Source and Destination - this GS1 tags are part of the extension
section and they are utilized by OriginTrail to determine which
parties are involved in consensus check. Also, if EventType is
Ownership, then ownership of products will be transferred from source
to destination.</li>
</ul>

<h2>XML EPCIS Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#xml-epcis-examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Provided examples describe proposed data structure and data flow. The
main goal is to elaborate data structuring process and features on ODN.
We have set out simple Manufacturer-Distributor-Retail (MDR) supply
chain where goods move only forward.</p>
<p>Supply chain consists of 4 entities:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Green - Manufacturer of wine</li>
<li>Pink - Distributor of beverages</li>
<li>Orange and Red - Retail shops</li>
</ul>
<p>For clarity and analysis examples deal with generic items called
Product1 and generic locations (with generic read points). Real life use
cases should utilize GS1 identifiers for values (GLN,GTIN…). For
example, instead value <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">urn:epc:id:sgln:Building_Green</span></code> there should
be GLN number like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">urn:epc:id:sgln:0614141.12345.0</span></code>.</p>
